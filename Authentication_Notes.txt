Implementation in Node.js:

1. Authentication Middleware:
   • In your Nodejs application, you might use middleware like Passport to handle the authentication process.
   • Passport helps verify the identity of the chef based on their provided credentials.

2. User Roles and Permissions:
   • You'll define roles for staff members (e.g., chef, waiter, manager). 
   • Authorization middleware will check the role of the authenticated user and grant access accordingly.

3. Secure Endpoints:
   • You'll protect certain routes (like updating menu items) with authentication checks.
   • Only authenticated and authorized users (like chefs) will be allowed to access these routes.


////////// Passport.js /////////////////////////////

1. Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. Authentication is the
process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through a username and password,
before granting access to certain resources or features on a website or application.

2. Think of Passport.js as a helpful tool that makes it easier for developers to handle user
authentication in their Node.js applications. It simplifies the process of authenticating
users by providing a set of pre-built strategies for different authentication methods,
such as username and password, social media logins (like Facebook or Google), and
more.
